This script repository spans the data processing and analyses of the study: "Cold adaptation and horizontal gene transfer shape Antarctic sponge microbiomes".

This research explores the functional differences in the microbiomes of Antarctic sponges against those of (i) tropical and temperate sponges and (ii) their surrounding seawater, especially focused on functions related to cold adaptation and the contribution of HGT in acquiring them.
